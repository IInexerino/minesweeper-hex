Mycology game idea:

# GENERAL IDEA
You play as a mycelial network in an interractive landscape, with a goal to dominate the landscape


# GENERAL CONCERNS
## Replayability
Replayable due to:
    ; variety of species to play as
    ; variety of environments to play in
    ; variety of viable strategic approaches fostering creativity

## Education
The game should be educational, it should teach players:
    ; Conceptualize the fungus as a networked organism (logistics, economic redundancy and trade offs)
    ; Learn the reproductive cycles (asexual spores, sexual spores, fruiting bodies)
    ; Learn about the ecological roles of various species (saprotrophic (decomposer), parasitic, mycorrhizal)
    ; Learn the real environmental constraints (pH, moisture, temp, substrate type)
    ; Learn about the chemical warfare they engage in; Recognize real world fungal structures

# GAME MECHANICS
## Environment   
The world is an interconnected, interractive, reactive ecosystem made up of hexagonal tiles (vertical hex tiles would be better to not just have horizontal lines of mycelim) with various attributes:
    ; state of matter (solid, liquid, gas)
    ; temperature
    ; nutrition
    ; moisture / humidity
    ; light avaliability
    ; other living organisms (sybiotic and competing)

    Symbiotic organisms potentially exchange resources with the player:
        ; mycorrhizal plants
    Antagonistic and competing organisms threaten the player
        Predetors:
            ; fungus gnat
            ; nematodes
            ; springtails
      Competitors:
            ; other fungi
            ; various bacteria

    
The world undergoes various seasonal and temporal shifts, which affects the hexagonal environment
    ; day / night
    ; winter / spring / summer / autumn

## Player
Must spread the network while managing resources

Mycelial networks have resource (nutrients, water) logistics, and input / outputs

Can receive resources from their environment:
    ; by simply absorbing resources
    ; by decomposing things into resources to be absorbed
        Enzymes have optimal environmental ranges
        Decomposition releases heat alters soil chemistry
    ; by exchanging with mutualistic organisms for resources to absorb
    ; by extracting and stealing resources from organisms to absorb

        
Can spread hyphae into neighboring hexagons
    - Hyphae extension has a resource and game-time cost
    - Overextension without too much consolidation to be more difficult and resource intensive

            
Mycelium can take various forms for various functions:
    ; dense mat (more intensive resource extraction)
    ; rhizomorphs (more rapid logistics)
    ; {sclerotia?}{This can present the player with exploration vs consolidation decisions}

        
Can focus on utility production (for defensive, offensive, exploratory purposes):
    ; production of acid which unlocks certain areas blocked by hard rock
    ; production of toxins
    ; hardening a segment of itself into a barrier structure

        
Can facilitae reproduction:
    - Sexual / asexual / fruiting-body reproduction determined by the species
    - Evolution / specialization system {...}
